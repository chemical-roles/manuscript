## Curation Methods

Following a reasonable formalization of the schema for the extension to ChEBI, a simple set of curation guidelines were generated.

1. Identify a ChEBI role such that each has a well-defined relation and target.
2. Ground the relation to a controlled vocabulary like the RO or another carefully annotated one.
3. Identify the target's type. This is often non-trivial, especially in the cases of agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists.
   For example, GABA antagonist [@CHEBI:65259] refers to the family of Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors [@hgnc.genefamily:562] while it may be mistaken to mean the chemical γ-aminobutyric acid [@CHEBI:16865].
   Alternatively, some roles really do seem to refer to the chemicals themselves such as vitamin B1 antagonist [@CHEBI:78248].
4. Ground the entity to a controlled vocabulary. Prefer those with easily accessible data such as those available through the [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org).
   In the many cases when protein complexes and protein families cannot be grounded to a pre-existing resource, submit additional curation to the FamPlex resource [@doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2211-5] following their curation guidelines.

Below is described how roles were identified in automated or semi-automated fashion and their names were pre-processed for search.
In many cases, the Gilda grounding tool [@https://github.com/indralab/gilda] was used to prioritize candidate groundings from select databases.

### Affix-Based Role Identification

There are a number of naming conventions within ChEBI that were leveraged to quickly identify entities to be curated.
Many roles that imply common semantics share common affixes (i.e., prefixes or suffixes).
In the case of enzyme classes, the nomenclature is standardized so well that the EC number could be parsed out and relations could be generated automatically.
In a few cases, this was not possible, and either additional rules were added to the parser or in several cases issues were filed to the ChEBI tracker [@https://github.com/ebi-chebi/ChEBI/issues] to make improvements.
Table {@tbl:affixes} enumerates several of these affixes at the end of the manuscript.

### Adaptation of ChIRO

Previously, the ChEBI Integrated Role Ontology (ChIRO) [@https://github.com/obophenotype/chiro] was generated to axiomize the relationships between select ChEBI roles and other OBO ontologies; primarily the Molecular Function branch of the GO.
Many of its ~200 entries connected EC inhibitors and activators to the corresponding molecular function in GO.
Additionally, a small number of exemplar axioms were added for other branches of GO and other ontologies, for example, anti-apoptosis utilizes the GO Biological Process apoptotic process [@GO:0006915].
The ChEBI role anti-arrythmia drug [@CHEBI:38070] connects to a phenotype ontology class for Arrythmia [@HP:0011675].
However, curation of ChIRO was manual and due to limited resources the initial set of axioms were never expanded.
ChIRO did not take advantage of lexical regularities, which could have been used to automate the axiomatization of large numbers of terms, in particular EC inhibitors and activators to the corresponding enzyme class, as shown below.
Throughout the process of incorporating ChIRO into this work, several improvements were suggested through its issue tracker [@https://github.com/obophenotype/chiro/issues].

### Hierarchy-Driven Role Identification

While affix-based search had relatively high precision (with the exception of -agent, which listed many applications that were not relevant in this context), most entries do not have a naming convention.
Luckily, ChEBI is an ontology with pre-defined hierarchies defining roles including enzyme inhibitor [@CHEBI:23924], central nervous system drug [@CHEBI:35470], antidote [@CHEBI:50247], and many others.
For example, the 8 sub-roles of antidote [@CHEBI:50247] were all identified by affix, but none of the subclasses of central nervous system depressant [@CHEBI:35488] were.

ChEBI's roles hierarchy is divided into three parts: chemical role [@CHEBI:51086], biological role [@CHEBI:24432], and application [@CHEBI:33232]. Within the latter two are the most interesting roles for curation, but not all are relevant. Therefore, a blacklist was developed including irrelevant applications like protecting group [@CHEBI:51087], dye [@CHEBI:37958], and MALDI matrix material [@CHEBI:64345] as well as irrelevant or misclassified biological roles like provitamin [@CHEBI:50188], insect attractant [@CHEBI:24850], and α-D-GalN-(1→4)-\[α-DD-Hep-(1→2)\]-α-D-GalA-yl group [@CHEBI:136367]. The remaining elements from these two role hierarchies were curated.

As curation over the remaining parts of the ChEBI hierarchy resulted in the largest number of suggestions, the curation scripts were careful to remove results from previously-curated terms to reduce curator fatigue.
Additionally, a list of false positives was developed and maintained throughout curation to reduce the number of propositions and ultimately reduce curator fatigue.

### Summary Statistics

There are several ways of summarizing the 828 roles that have been curated so far.
Below, the Figure {@fig:curated-summary} summarizes the types of modulations and target entity types.
