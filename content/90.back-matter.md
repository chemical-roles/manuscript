|        | Affix            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prefix | anti-                          | Various agents against biological processes (e.g., anti-inflammatory drug [@CHEBI:35472]), pathologies (e.g., antihyperplasia drug [@CHEBI:5984]), and organisms (e.g., anti-HIV-1 agent [@CHEBI:64947]).
| Prefix | antidote to-                   | Antidotes for poisons (e.g., antidote to opioid poisoning [@CHEBI:90755]).
| Both   | EC-...-inhibitor or -activator | Inhibitors of enzymes. The ChEBI hierarchy of roles implicitly models the enzyme classification with the root term being enzyme inhibitor [@CHEBI:23924]. However, some terms have the suffix of -activator, which do not have corresponding roles nor a corresponding root term enzyme activator.
| Suffix | -activator                     | Activators of proteins (e.g., p53 activator [@CHEBI:77731]), protein complexes (e.g., soluble guanylate cyclase activator [@CHEBI:76022]), protein families (e.g., UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activator [@CHEBI:77324]), enzyme classes (e.g., EC 2.7.11.31 {[hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] kinase} activator [@CHEBI:85053]), pathways (e.g., hypoxia-inducible factor pathway activator [@CHEBI:134083])
| Suffix | -inducer                       | Inducers of protein families (e.g., Hsp70 inducer [@CHEBI:78606]), pathways (e.g. apoptosis inducer [@CHEBI:68495]). The difference in semantics between activator and inducer is unclear, and it seems that activator was preferred by ChEBI curators. Only three entries, interferon inducer [@CHEBI:36710] being the third, have this suffix.
| Suffix | -inhibitor                     | Inhibitors of proteins (e.g., MTP inhibitor [@CHEBI:72298]), protein complexes (e.g., eukaryotic initiation factor 4F inhibitor [@CHEBI:137079]), protein families (e.g. glycine transporter inhibitor [@CHEBI:85425]), enzyme classes (e.g., EC 1.1.1.188 (prostaglandin-F synthase) inhibitor [@CHEBI:77425]), pathways (e.g., autophagy inhibitor [@CHEBI:88230])
| Suffix | -agonist                       | Agonists of proteins (e.g., aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist [@CHEBI:72768]), protein families (e.g., cannabinoid receptor agonist [@CHEBI:67072])
| Suffix | -antagonist                    | Antagonists of proteins (e.g., aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist [@CHEBI:76998]), protein families (e.g., cannabinoid receptor antagonist [@CHEBI:73413])
| Suffix | -inverse agonist               | Inverse agonists of proteins (e.g., 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor inverse agonist [@CHEBI:133016]), protein families (e.g., liver X receptor inverse agonist [@CHEBI:90846]). Unfortunately, these are the only two such entries. They both inherit from inverse agonist [@CHEBI:90847].
| Suffix | -modulator                     | Modulators (lacking the polarity described by activators or inhibitors) of proteins (e.g., retinoic acid receptor modulator [@CHEBI:90708]), protein complexes (e.g., Î³-secretase modulator [@CHEBI:48668]), protein families (e.g., PPAR modulator [@CHEBI:70781]), cellular components (e.g., tubulin modulator [@CHEBI:60832])
| Suffix | -suppressor / -suppressant     | Like -inducer, there are only a handful of examples. The preferred suffix is -inhibitor
| Suffix | -deactivator                   | Surprisingly, there were no terms in ChEBI using this suffix
| Suffix | -drug                          | Drugs treating pathways (e.g., anti-inflammatory drug [@CHEBI:35472]), pathologies (e.g., antiglaucoma drug [@CHEBI:39456]), infections (e.g., trypanocidal drug [@CHEBI:36335]), and psychoses (e.g., tranquilizing drug [@CHEBI:35473]). However, most drugs treating psychoses are children of central nervous system drug [@CHEBI:35470] and do not end in the suffix -drug.
| Suffix | -agent                         | Agents cover a wide variety of biology from drugs (e.g., antihypotensive agent [@CHEBI:137431]) to toxins/poisons (e.g., VR nerve agent [@CHEBI:140422]) and other applications.
| Suffix | -stabilizer / -stabiliser      | This search was included because of the notes from ChIRO, but no terms in ChEBI corresponded to it.
| Suffix | -destabilizer / -destabiliser  | This search was included because of the notes from ChIRO, but no terms in ChEBI corresponded to it.
| Suffix | -sensitizer / -sensitiser      | This search was included because of the notes from ChIRO, but no terms in ChEBI had this suffix besides the role sensitiser [@CHEBI:139492]
