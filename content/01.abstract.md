## Motivation {.page_break_before}

The Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) [@pmid:23180789; @pmid: 26467479] ontology models chemicals, their classes,
their roles, and their interrelations (Figure {@fig:overview}, left). While many roles correspond to how their
substituent chemicals affect proteins, protein families, protein complexes, pathways, pathologies, or organisms, this
information is unstructured. Yan *et al.* previously described how these correspondences could be theoretically
formalized [@ying2011]. This article proposes a concrete schema and axioms through which these roles can be linked to their target
entities (Figure {@fig:overview}, right), a suite of open source, reusable curation tools, and ultimately a manually
curated database of relationships between chemical roles and their targets.

Targets may be other chemicals, proteins, protein families, protein
complexes, pathways, pathologies, or organisms.](images/overview.svg){#fig:overview}

Throughout this article, the term role (in the context of the ChEBI ontology) will be used in the colloquial sense
described by Batchelor *et al.* [@isbn:9781607505341] rather than the formal sense prescribed by the
Basic Formal Ontology [@doi:10.3233/AO-160164; @arXiv:1502.04108].
