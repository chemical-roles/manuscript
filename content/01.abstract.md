## Motivation {.page_break_before}

The Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI [@pmid:23180789]) ontology models chemicals, their classes,
their roles, and their interrelations (Figure 1, left). While many roles correspond to how their substituent chemicals
affect proteins, protein families, protein complexes, pathways, pathologies, or organisms, this information is
unstructured. Yan et al. (2011) previously described how these correspondences could be theoretically formalized.
This article proposes a concrete schema and axioms through which these roles can be linked to their target entities
(Figure 1, right), a suite of open source, reusable curation tools, and ultimately a manually curated database of
relationships between chemical roles and their targets.

Targets may be other chemicals, proteins, protein families, protein
complexes, pathways, pathologies, or organisms.](images/overview.svg){#fig:1}

Throughout this article, the term role (in the context of the ChEBI ontology) will be used in the colloquial sense
described by Batchelor et al. (2010) rather than the formal sense prescribed by the Basic Formal Ontology
(Smith et al., 2005).
