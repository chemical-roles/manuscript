Here, we apply the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) to structure a passage about the Roman Constitution from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Specifically, we consider the specification of Roles such as Consuls, Activities associated with those Roles, and Procedures for accomplishing those Activities. ",

    "abstract": "ChEBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi) is a database and ontology of chemical entities of biological interest. Over the past few years, ChEBI has continued to grow steadily in content, and has added several new features. In addition to incorporating all user-requested compounds, our annotation efforts have emphasized immunology, natural products and metabolites in many species. All database entries are now 'is_a' classified within the ontology, meaning that all of the chemicals are available to semantic reasoning tools that harness the classification hierarchy. We have completely aligned the ontology with the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry-recommended upper level Basic Formal Ontology. Furthermore, we have aligned our chemical classification with the classification of chemical-involving processes in the Gene Ontology (GO), and as a result of this effort, the majority of chemical-involving processes in GO are now defined in terms of the ChEBI entities that participate in them. This effort necessitated incorporating many additional biologically relevant compounds. We have incorporated additional data types including reference citations, and the species and component for metabolites. Finally, our website and web services have had several enhancements, most notably the provision of a dynamic new interactive graph-based ontology visualization.",

It currently includes over 46,000 entries, each of which is classified within the ontology and assigned multiple annotations including (where relevant) a chemical structure, database cross-references, synonyms and literature citations. All content is freely available and can be accessed online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi. In this update paper, we describe recent improvements and additions to the ChEBI offering. We have substantially extended our collection of endogenous metabolites for several organisms including human, mouse, Escherichia coli and yeast. Our front-end has also been reworked and updated, improving the user experience, removing our dependency on Java applets in favour of embedded JavaScript components and moving from a monthly release update to a 'live' website. Programmatic access has been improved by the introduction of a library, libChEBI, in Java, Python and Matlab. Furthermore, we have added two new tools, namely an analysis tool, BiNChE, and a query tool for the ontology, OntoQuery.",

    "event": "International Conference on Biomedical Ontology",
    "event-place": "Buffalo, NY, USA",
    "abstract": "ChEBI is an ontology of biologically interesting chemicals. Biological activities of chemical entities comprise interactions with biological entities such as proteins and anatomical structures such as the cell membrane. Currently. ChEBI represents these biological activities of small molecules within a 'role' ontology which includes terms such as 'cyclooxygenase inhibitor'. However, this 'role' ontology is not complete, and is not directly interlinked with the biological ontologies which serve as the main source of concepts describing biological entities. This makes it difficult to reason over the relationships between chemical entities and their biological targets. To address this issue, we propose a model for interrelating multiple ontologies and controlled vocabularies in the biomedical domain in order to formally characterise the bioactivity of small molecules. In support of this work, we have developed a method for analysing the scientific literature for textual descriptions of bioactivity events linked to chemical entities. We examine the distribution of terms from various controlled vocabularies (biological processes, proteins, organisms and organ/body parts) in combination with the chemical entities in the literature, to better understand reports of bioactivity. We find that proteins are the most commonly reported type of target of small molecule bioactivity, and that organisms and organs are most commonly reported in the literature as locational constraints rather than as targets.",
